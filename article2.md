# Conversations Should Work Like Using a Terminal

Over the years of my life i've noticed something about myself, what i noticed is that as i failed more and more to pick up on important social cues, i started realizing that the only reason that people have issues with one another is because of the lack of proper interpretation between people and what they are saying.

Or, more importantly: What they THINK they are saying.

The thing is with "normal people" is that they're brain keeps getting attached to the dumbest things when they're communicating, stuff like tone, posture, "body language" (there's no such thing as body language btw, it's just retards that just like to overanalyze shit too much) and all of this shit just clutters up what is ultimately a very simple societal function, which is to simply say what you mean and move along.

What i've learned then, because of this is that while most NT people look down on Autists and simply assume they are incapable of communicating, it's actually the opposite that is true: Autistic people communicate very well - you just need to stop overanalyzing their behavior.

And that's what's so great about using a terminal, or, more accurately, speaking as if one only cared about the actual words being said. Let me explain.

In a terminal, there is no inherited context (usually) so you have to write in context first. so for example, if you want the terminal to find something on your hard drive, you can't just write "it's somewhere on my hard drive" you have to say "it's in C:/programfiles/folder" or "cd Home/Documents". 

Doesn't that make things so much easier?

Here's another example: In the terminal, once again there is no inherited knowledge of anything, so you (usually) have to define it, which means you can't just go "hey can you do this thing for me? thanks" it's much more efficient to just say "Hey, i need you to do this, you'll have to search through this and modify it and put it here"

Now the cool thing is that once the terminal identifies what these actions are by name, you can just say the name of the action like you'd "normally" do.

And here's yet another example: While a terminal doesn't feel emotion, the user usually does feel some sort of emotional reaction to it for one reason or another. so if you want to express these emotions, you should simply do it cleanly, bluntly, because holding back really helps no one, despite what you might have deducted from you shitty neurotypical existence (or by being in contact with shitty neurotypicals for way too long).

Well anyway, i guess that's the kind of paradise we'll never have.
So, Goodbye.
