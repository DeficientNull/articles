# My Anxieties with Development

i've noticed myself go back and forth between two stages of making things
1. get really excited about something, plan a lot, think nothing will go wrong because this time i can control my own mind
2. well i can't control my own mind, and now i'm spending all this time doing things peripheral to the thing i like doing, rather than doing the thing itself
and of course i think of taking a break, but what always happens is i take too long of a break, and motivation never comes back. 

I think now that i've started really noticing this is why i feel really frustrated by it, and why i'm still just working at it anyway even if the risk of burning out is real

I like working on stuff, i LOVE working on stuff - but sometimes it feels like my brain hijacks this feeling and the project with it, and i'm not sure what to do about it. I just know i need to stop being so inconsistent, cause everytime i do good things generally come from it. Just feel stuck in general i suppose

Current project i'm working on has a lot of waiting involved, and not the good kind. Asking questions when using this kind of tookit feels like wasting people's time, i should just be able to read the documentation and example code and figure it out, but i can't so every time i ask a question i feel like i'm enabling a ticking time bomb, cause eventually people will get fed up with my bullshit and won't answer anymore and i'm fucked.

There are upsides of course, so much of this toolset already does litterally everything i've ever wanted when it comes to handling assets, it's honestly a dream come true when it comes to that. And people seem to be really impressed by what i've managed to cook up with it on a fairly short amount of time.

idk, guess i just needed to vent

TODO: for this next week
- need to finish working on this test shit, it's taken way too much of my time
- want to get into renoise this week
- want to release a simple website that just links to all my stuff. TinyHost seems good but i need to relearn some HTML/JavaScript first, shouldn't take long
